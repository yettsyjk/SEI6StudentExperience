# SEI6 Student Experience
## What happened to me?
1. I want to thank you for allowing me a few moments of your time to explain my journey of the first few weeks at GA. 
1. Let me just begin by stating the facts: I had no idea what a command line interface was and the prework should have been weeks of work for me instead of the 60 hours they required. I knew nothing other than I needed a new career. 
1. I was hovering at 17% homework rate for what felt like forever until I had two major shifts in STATE. I remember emailing the staff for dropping out procedures because I just could not get it together. Micah could see how behind I was and I'm sure I stressed him out quite a bit. I'm now at 83% pretty proud that I understand the concepts taught.

## Shift in STATE
1. First shift in state was directly related to my family and their extreme support to kick my behind in gear. It had been years since they experienced failure with me, and they were not going to let me go there again. They stood up to me and demanded a change in my behavior. Intense right? That's how we roll in my house. 
1. Second shift was directly internal. I let my ego get the best of me and almost let that wreck these amazing adventures with my peers at SEI6. I had to literally tell myself to 'shut up'. I was 'behind on my dreams and now my bills' and my mind was doing the talking. 'Girl shut it and keep pushing!'. 

## Getting it together
1. After school I would stay late with some of my peers and utilized my resources (Josh Smith). I went back to the pre-work and worked on the keywords comparing them to the calendar lesson of the day ahead, that way I wasn't as brand new to the concepts. Don't forget your PR's (pull requests) can have notes to the instructor. Use them.
1. Organize yourself and plan your day properly. During project 1, I recommend you utilize a time keeping app to help you understand managing your time during project week. I literally was found by one of my peers out in the parking-lot "lost". I had times set to step away from my project to re-group my thoughts.

## Lean on your Team
1. Questions yep, I absolutely had some in class as well as the saved questions for personal calendar times with Josh. (Get on the calendar quickly).
1. My peers, yep they are resources as well. After research and review of documentation I asked them questions regarding concepts that I wasn't grasping. Our crew has some natural teachers, and they were glad to help me understand some topics. I saw my peers more than I would see my family and our cohort was able to build a great relationship of fun, joking around, and communicating remotely when we needed help. 

### That's it for me I hope this information helps you somehow. Thanks for your time.
